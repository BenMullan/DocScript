DocScript Solution Conventions and General Notes
------------------------------------------------


Notation:
---------
No.				Number Of
UpToInc *		Up To and Including *
UpToExc *		Up To but Excluding *
<*>				Of the DataType * (DocScript Source)
_*				* is an Identifier for a Local Item
*_				* is an Identifier for a Private or Protected Item
*__				* is an identifier for a Friend Item
_*_				* is an Identifier for a Static Item (Not SHARED, but Static as in one instance of the object for all StackFrames of a Method)
T*				* is a Generic Type Specifier
I*				* is an Interface
Ensures *		Throws an Exception if * is not the case
DS*Exception	* is a DocScript DataType inheriting from System.Exception
[*]				WebParts: * will be returned by the API
[...*]			WebParts: * will be returned by the API, when Long-Polling ends
[<*>]			WebParts: * will be returned by the API, as an XML-Child of <ResponseContent>


General:
--------
CompilerExpentions should generally not modify the input parameter; they should only return the output. The Method names should reflect this. E.g., "WithLastCharacterRemoved()" instead of "RemoveLastCharacter()"
Solution Files are named according to whatever the most narrowed-down logical container is (Namespace, Class, or Module etc...)
Remember to "ALTER DATABASE [DocScript] SET ENABLE_BROKER;" in order for [SqlDependancy]s to work...
The ToString() of an Instruction or Expression, returns what the it would have looked like in the Source


Volcabulary:
------------
Upstairs/Downstairs		A new recursivly-created stack frame, logically above/below the current one on the Stack
Upstream/Downstream		A component which exists forwards/backwards of the current one, along a linear structure


[Ctrl + F] Global Search Codes:
-------------------------------
**NI			Not Implemented
**ToDo			Minor improvement to be made at a later date
**ChangeLog		A component of an algorithm has been updated on the specified date
