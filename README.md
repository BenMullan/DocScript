### There are four DocScript *Implementations*...
1. **A Graphical IDE**, `DSIDE.exe`:

2. **A Command-line Interpreter**, `DSCLI.exe`:

3. **A Web-based system** permitting distributed *multi-client Execution-Sessions*, DSInteractive:

**Note:** All three implementations rely on the Core Interpretation Logic within `DocScript.Library.dll`


# Getting Started...
- Download `DSSetup.msi` (or just the binaries) from [§Releases](https://github.com/BenMullan/DocScript/releases)
- Launch DocScript IDE, and try a sample program from "Insert Code Snippet...". Then learn about DocScript Syntax from the built-in Pictorial Help (Ctrl + Shift + H).
- ...Or, run `DSCLI.exe /?`
- ...Or, read `\DSWebParts\(Source)\DatabaseResources\_CreateEntireDB.SQL` for DSInteractive Setup guidance.
