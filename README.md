# DocScript
A simple, procedural programming language, supporting real-time, multi-client Execution Sessions, and numeric literals in different bases. (BM A-Level CS Coursework 2023)

### Source Example
Here's an example of a DocScript Program to solve [the Lightswitch Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UBDRX6bk-A)

### There are 3 DocScript *Implementations*...
1. **A Graphical IDE**, `DSIDE.exe`:

2. **A Command-line Interpreter**, `DSCLI.exe`:

3. **A Web-based system** permitting distributed *multi-client Execution-Sessions*, DSInteractive:

**Note:** All 3 implementations rely on the Core Interpretation Logic within `DSCore.dll` (which was previously called `DocScript.Library.dll`)


# Getting Started...
- Download `DSSetup.msi` (or just the binaries) from [§Releases](https://github.com/BenMullan/DocScript/releases)
- Launch DocScript IDE, and try a sample program from "Insert Code Snippet...". Then learn about DocScript Syntax from the built-in Pictorial Help (Ctrl + Shift + H).
- ...Or, run `DSCLI.exe /?`
- ...Or, read `\DSWebParts\(Source)\DatabaseResources\_CreateEntireDB.SQL` for DSInteractive Setup guidance
- **Take a look at the [§DocScript Sample Programs](https://github.com/BenMullan/DocScript/tree/master/_Resources/SamplePrograms/)** to see some of the cool [Multimedia](https://github.com/BenMullan/DocScript/blob/master/_Resources/SamplePrograms/PlayWav.DS), [Networking](https://github.com/BenMullan/DocScript/blob/master/_Resources/SamplePrograms/Curl.DS), and [Data-Processing](https://github.com/BenMullan/DocScript/blob/master/_Resources/SamplePrograms/LambdaWhere.DS) abilities of the language...

<br/><br/>Did you really just make it all the way to the end of this README? Well done!
